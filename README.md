# HueSprite
For cocos2dx 3.6.1

Using shaders to change textures' hue-value to render sprites with different colors but the same texture. 

For example, this can be used for games that different players have different forces, you can use HueSprite to show different force color but using only one set of textures. This is a good way to decrease internal memory for games.
